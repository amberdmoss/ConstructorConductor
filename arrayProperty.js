//Just like you can add methods to your own constructor, you can also add methods and properties to built in classes in JavaScript like Arrays and Objects.

//Add a reverse method to the String 'class' so that every instance of String can call reverse and reverse itself.


	function reverse(s) {
  return s.split('class').reverse().join('');
